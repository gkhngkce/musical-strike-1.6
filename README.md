# musical-strike-1.6

This is a project that aims to allow its users to play games with a musical instrument.

We have tuned it for Counter Strike 1.6 and a recorder(flute). 

The packages you need to use this project are

pydirectinput
pyautogui
numpy
pyaudio
playsound
keyboard
wave

The program maps keyboard keys to the notes(to being more specific midi numbers) to play game with a recorder flute.

You can change instrument by changing the NOTE_MIN - NOTE_MAX values on the code.

To change instrument you should use the note-reffrence image on the project.
